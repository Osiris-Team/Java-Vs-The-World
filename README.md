# Java-Vs-The-World
A repo dedicated to showing why Java is better than all other languages.

I think that 99% of algorithms are faster in Java in their second run than
in any other Language due to the better JIT compiler and optimizations that are possible.
I am talking about the GraalVM distribution of Java and its latest version, but we might as well use other distros.

You can find the results [here](results_summary.md).

Feel free to contribute by enhancing algorithms and providing new ones to compare!

We try to:
- Use the max amount of optimizations for all languages.
- Use (a tiny bit) random inputs to simulate a more realistic initial state of the program.
- Use various implementations of a language.
