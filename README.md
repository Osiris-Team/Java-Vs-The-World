# Lang-Benchmarks
Some interesting performance Benchmarks to compare multiple languages with the focus on Java.

You can find the results [here](results_summary.md).

Feel free to contribute by enhancing algorithms and providing new ones to compare!

We try to:
- Use the max amount of optimizations for all languages.
- Use (a tiny bit) random inputs to simulate a more realistic initial state of the program.
- Use various implementations of a language.
