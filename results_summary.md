# Prime Counting Benchmark Results

This file contains the results of running a prime-counting algorithm across various programming languages.

**Benchmark Details:**
- Problem size: Count primes up to 1,000,000.
- Environment: GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runners.
- Timings: Only the second run of the algorithm is measured for warm-up optimization.
